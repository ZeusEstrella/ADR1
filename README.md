Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

Scenario 1

Context:
The retail mobile app project aims to provide a comprehensive shopping experience that includes browsing products, order tracking, and loyalty program management. It requires offline support, push notifications, payment gateway integration, analytics, image optimization, and internationalization.

Decision:

propose the architectural decisions for the retail mobile app


1. Native Mobile App:

Decision: We recommend the development of a native mobile application for both iOS and Android platforms.

Rationale: This recommendation is based on the fact that native apps provide better performance and full access to device capabilities, resulting in a consistent and responsive user experience across multiple platforms.

2. Push Notification Service:

Decision: We suggest integrating the Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) service for push notifications.

Rationale: FCM is a robust and cross-platform solution that supports targeted notifications, which are essential for receiving order updates and exclusive offers.

3. Payment Gateway Integration:

Decision: recommend the integration of a combination of payment gateways, including Stripe, PayPal, and Apple Pay.

Rationale: This combination of payment gateways offers a high level of security, ease of use, and compatibility with the app's target platforms.


4. Analytics Tool:

Decision: We propose using Google Analytics for tracking user behaviour.

Rationale: Google Analytics provides detailed insights and metrics and supports both Android and iOS, making it a versatile choice.

5. Image Storage and Optimization:

Decision: We propose using a CDN for image storage and implementing caching, lazy loading, and compression.

Rationale: This approach provides an efficient and responsive image delivery system while conserving bandwidth and data usage.

6. Internationalization and Localization:

Decision: We recommend implementing internationalization and localization using React Native's internationalization library.

Rationale: React Native's library simplifies the process of supporting multiple languages and cultural preferences while maintaining code consistency.

Consequences:

Our goal is to create a high-performance mobile app with an optimal user experience. We will use image optimization techniques to minimize data usage, enable comprehensive analytics, and ensure secure transactions. The app will also have internationalization and localization features to adapt to different cultural preferences.

Alternatives Considered:

We considered alternative options for payment gateways, analytics tools, and internationalization libraries. However, the choices made align best with the project's requirements and goals.
